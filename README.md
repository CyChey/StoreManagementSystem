With this program, I decided to create a program that would give information about a store.
You will have the ability to add a new employee while also giving details such as name and how much they are being paid.
You will also be able to add a new manager and just like the employee, you'll have options to add name and amount they are making. This will be more than the employee so it will include a bonus pay.
I will also include information about a store. This will include store number, payroll information and employee/managers that are currently working in the store.
