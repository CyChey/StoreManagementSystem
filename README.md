Hi, I'm Cyrena!

I am currently working on a software that I hope would help those in customer service. As someone who used to work in the food industry as a manager, 
I understand how difficult the programs that are currently out there can be. 
With this program, I decided to create a program that would give information about a store and those that work there.
You will have the ability to add a new employee while also giving details such as a name and how much they are being paid. I hope to include other details as well, such as years of experience or areas of expertise.
You will also be able to add a new manager and just like the employee, you'll have options to add name and amount they are making. This will be more than the employee so it will also include a bonus pay or bonus rate.
I will also include information about the store itself. This will include store number, payroll information and employee/managers that are currently working in the store. I also hope to implement information such as sales and products being sold. 
My final vision of this is to be similar to a software someone in a managerial position would use to keep track of all the important things that go on in the store,
such as new hires, payroll and sales reports.
